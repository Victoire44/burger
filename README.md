Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.

Use of Node and MysSQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

This app follows the MVC design pattern: Model, View, Controller.
